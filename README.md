Our inspiration stems from a an earlier hackathon where we looked at creating forward contracts on ETH and saw that there is an application around agriculture and farming, and thought it would be cool if we can make the instrument simpler and realized binary options allow for that, and we can further simplify by mimicking weather derivatives; but also realized that such instruments are rarely available to the average farmer across the world, and putting it on chain and allowing for regular people to come in and create and operate a dual sided mkt is a powerful thing.

What it does
the marketplace allows for users to take either side of a event outcome, weather is hot or weather is cold for ex. or will it rain or not rain. this effectively allows for farmers, and speculators to create event markets around such binary outcomes and take a hedge on their crops or harvest. This same market can be extrapolated to weather an event is held due to inclement weather, for ex. does rain cancel the game?
